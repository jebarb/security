a) 
  1. 3 (pdf was more effective for me)
  2. 3
  3. 4
  4. 4
b) Being able to actually complete the labs would have been nice. Maybe more
   info about preparation for labs in the future?
c) Probably just learning immunity
d) We more or less followed the instructions exactly. Our only issue came about
   when we tried to place the entire payload after the SEH where there wasn't
   enough room. We ended up getting tunnel vision while trying to figure out
   how to do a jump to the memory before the SEH (which we were trying to do
   from the next SEH handler pointer, where we didn't have enough space for the
   relative jump), so we went to office hours and Jan drew an arrow from one 
   memory segment to another, and we realized "oh yeah, we already have 
   arbitrary code execution, just do a jump." 

   After that we placed the relative jump after the SEH, placed the payload
   before the SEH (where the program expected the string), and all was well.

e) 1-9 hours
f) James Barbour, Brandon Davis
