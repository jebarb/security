Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
"Tis some visiter," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door--
                                          Only this, and nothing more."

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow:--vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore--
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--
                                          Nameless here for evermore.

And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
"Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door
Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;--
                                          This it is, and nothing more."

Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
"Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you"--here I opened wide the door;--
                                          Darkness there, and nothing more.

Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore!"
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!"
                                          Merely this and nothing more.

Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping, somewhat louder than before.
"Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice;
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore--
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;--
                                          Tis the wind and nothing more!"

Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--
                                          Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore,--
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"
                                          Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
                                          With such name as "Nevermore."

But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
Nothing further then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered--
Till I scarcely more than muttered, "Other friends have flown before--
On the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."
                                          Then the bird said, "Nevermore."

Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
                                          Of 'Never--nevermore.'"

But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore
                                          Meant in croaking "Nevermore."

This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated oer,
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating oer
                                          _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!

Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
"Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath sent thee
Respite--respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!"
                                          Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!--
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--
On this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore--
Is there--_is_ there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!"
                                          Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil--prophet still, if bird or devil!
By that Heaven that bends above, us--by that God we both adore--
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."
                                          Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I shrieked, upstarting--
"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"
                                          Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
And the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
                                          Shall be lifted--nevermore!
NOT TO BE PREPARED IS THE GREATEST OF CRIMES
TO BE PREPARED BEFOREHAND FOR ANY CONTINGENCY IS THE GREATEST OF VIRTUES

ACCORDING AS CIRCUMSTANCES ARE FAVORABLE ONE SHOULD MODIFY ONES PLANS

ALL WARFARE IS BASED ON DECEPTION
HENCE WHEN ABLE TO ATTACK WE MUST SEEM UNABLE
WHEN USING OUR FORCES WE MUST SEEM INACTIVE 
WHEN WE ARE NEAR WE MUST MAKE THE ENEMY BELIEVE WE ARE FAR AWAY 
WHEN FAR AWAY WE MUST MAKE HIM BELIEVE WE ARE NEAR
HOLD OUT BAITS TO ENTICE THE ENEMY FEIGN DISORDER AND CRUSH HIM
IF HE IS SECURE AT ALL POINTS BE PREPARED FOR HIM IF HE IS IN SUPERIOR STRENGTH EVADE HIM
IF YOUR OPPONENT IS OF CHOLERIC TEMPER SEEK TO IRRITATE HIM PRETEND TO BE WEAK THAT HE MAY GROW ARROGANT
IF HE IS TAKING HIS EASE GIVE HIM NO REST IF HIS FORCES ARE UNITED SEPARATE THEM
ATTACK HIM WHERE HE IS UNPREPARED APPEAR WHERE YOU ARE NOT EXPECTED

THERE IS NO INSTANCE OF A COUNTRY HAVING BENEFITED FROM PROLONGED WARFARE
IN WAR THEN LET YOUR GREAT OBJECT BE VICTORY NOT LENGTHY CAMPAIGNS

SUN TZU SAID THE GOOD FIGHTERS OF OLD FIRST PUT THEMSELVES BEYOND THE POSSIBILITY OF DEFEAT AND THEN WAITED FOR AN OPPORTUNITY OF DEFEATING THE ENEMY
TO SECURE OURSELVES AGAINST DEFEAT LIES IN OUR OWN HANDS BUT THE OPPORTUNITY OF DEFEATING THE ENEMY IS PROVIDED BY THE ENEMY HIMSELF
THUS THE GOOD FIGHTER IS ABLE TO SECURE HIMSELF AGAINST DEFEAT BUT CANNOT MAKE CERTAIN OF DEFEATING THE ENEMY
HENCE THE SAYING ONE MAY KNOW HOW TO CONQUER WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO DO IT
SECURITY AGAINST DEFEAT IMPLIES DEFENSIVE TACTICS 
ABILITY TO DEFEAT THE ENEMY MEANS TAKING THE OFFENSIVE

WHAT THE ANCIENTS CALLED A CLEVER FIGHTER IS ONE WHO NOT ONLY WINS BUT EXCELS IN WINNING WITH EASE
HENCE HIS VICTORIES BRING HIM NEITHER REPUTATION FOR WISDOM NOR CREDIT FOR COURAGE

THE CLEVER COMBATANT IMPOSES HIS WILL ON THE ENEMY BUT DOES NOT ALLOW THE ENEMYS WILL TO BE IMPOSED ON HIM
BY HOLDING OUT ADVANTAGES TO HIM HE CAN CAUSE THE ENEMY TO APPROACH OF HIS OWN ACCORD OR BY INFLICTING DAMAGE HE CAN MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE ENEMY TO DRAW NEAR
IF THE ENEMY IS TAKING HIS EASE HE CAN HARASS HIM IF WELL SUPPLIED WITH FOOD HE CAN STARVE HIM OUT IF QUIETLY ENCAMPED HE CAN FORCE HIM TO MOVE

IN WAR PRACTICE DISSIMULATION AND YOU WILL SUCCEED
WHETHER TO CONCENTRATE OR TO DIVIDE YOUR TROOPS MUST BE DECIDED BY CIRCUMSTANCES
LET YOUR RAPIDITY BE THAT OF THE WIND YOUR COMPACTNESS THAT OF THE FOREST
IN RAIDING AND PLUNDERING BE LIKE FIRE IS IMMOVABILITY LIKE A MOUNTAIN
LET YOUR PLANS BE DARK AND IMPENETRABLE AS NIGHT AND WHEN YOU MOVE FALL LIKE A THUNDERBOLT

PONDER AND DELIBERATE BEFORE YOU MAKE A MOVE
HE WILL CONQUER WHO HAS LEARNT THE ARTIFICE OF DEVIATION SUCH IS THE ART OF MANEUVERING

IT IS A MILITARY AXIOM NOT TO ADVANCE UPHILL AGAINST THE ENEMY NOR TO OPPOSE HIM WHEN HE COMES DOWNHILL
DO NOT PURSUE AN ENEMY WHO SIMULATES FLIGHT DO NOT ATTACK SOLDIERS WHOSE TEMPER IS KEEN
DO NOT SWALLOW BAIT OFFERED BY THE ENEMY DO NOT INTERFERE WITH AN ARMY THAT IS RETURNING HOME
WHEN YOU SURROUND AN ARMY LEAVE AN OUTLET FREE DO NOT PRESS A DESPERATE FOE TOO HARD

THE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH TO MANAGE AN ARMY IS TO SET UP ONE STANDARD OF COURAGE WHICH ALL MUST REACH
HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF BOTH STRONG AND WEAKTHAT IS A QUESTION INVOLVING THE PROPER USE OF GROUND
THUS THE SKILLFUL GENERAL CONDUCTS HIS ARMY JUST AS THOUGH HE WERE LEADING A SINGLE MAN WILLYNILLY BY THE HAND
IT IS THE BUSINESS OF A GENERAL TO BE QUIET AND THUS ENSURE SECRECY UPRIGHT AND JUST AND THUS MAINTAIN ORDER
HE MUST BE ABLE TO MYSTIFY HIS OFFICERS AND MEN BY FALSE REPORTS AND APPEARANCES AND THUS KEEP THEM IN TOTAL IGNORANCE
BY ALTERING HIS ARRANGEMENTS AND CHANGING HIS PLANS HE KEEPS THE ENEMY WITHOUT DEFINITE KNOWLEDGE BY SHIFTING HIS CAMP AND TAKING CIRCUITOUS ROUTES HE PREVENTS THE ENEMY FROM ANTICIPATING HIS PURPOSE
AT THE CRITICAL MOMENT THE LEADER OF AN ARMY ACTS LIKE ONE WHO HAS CLIMBED UP A HEIGHT AND THEN KICKS AWAY THE LADDER BEHIND HIM HE CARRIES HIS MEN DEEP INTO HOSTILE TERRITORY BEFORE HE SHOWS HIS HAND
