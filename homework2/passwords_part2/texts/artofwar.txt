NOT TO BE PREPARED IS THE GREATEST OF CRIMES
TO BE PREPARED BEFOREHAND FOR ANY CONTINGENCY IS THE GREATEST OF VIRTUES

ACCORDING AS CIRCUMSTANCES ARE FAVORABLE ONE SHOULD MODIFY ONES PLANS

ALL WARFARE IS BASED ON DECEPTION
HENCE WHEN ABLE TO ATTACK WE MUST SEEM UNABLE
WHEN USING OUR FORCES WE MUST SEEM INACTIVE 
WHEN WE ARE NEAR WE MUST MAKE THE ENEMY BELIEVE WE ARE FAR AWAY 
WHEN FAR AWAY WE MUST MAKE HIM BELIEVE WE ARE NEAR
HOLD OUT BAITS TO ENTICE THE ENEMY FEIGN DISORDER AND CRUSH HIM
IF HE IS SECURE AT ALL POINTS BE PREPARED FOR HIM IF HE IS IN SUPERIOR STRENGTH EVADE HIM
IF YOUR OPPONENT IS OF CHOLERIC TEMPER SEEK TO IRRITATE HIM PRETEND TO BE WEAK THAT HE MAY GROW ARROGANT
IF HE IS TAKING HIS EASE GIVE HIM NO REST IF HIS FORCES ARE UNITED SEPARATE THEM
ATTACK HIM WHERE HE IS UNPREPARED APPEAR WHERE YOU ARE NOT EXPECTED

THERE IS NO INSTANCE OF A COUNTRY HAVING BENEFITED FROM PROLONGED WARFARE
IN WAR THEN LET YOUR GREAT OBJECT BE VICTORY NOT LENGTHY CAMPAIGNS

SUN TZU SAID THE GOOD FIGHTERS OF OLD FIRST PUT THEMSELVES BEYOND THE POSSIBILITY OF DEFEAT AND THEN WAITED FOR AN OPPORTUNITY OF DEFEATING THE ENEMY
TO SECURE OURSELVES AGAINST DEFEAT LIES IN OUR OWN HANDS BUT THE OPPORTUNITY OF DEFEATING THE ENEMY IS PROVIDED BY THE ENEMY HIMSELF
THUS THE GOOD FIGHTER IS ABLE TO SECURE HIMSELF AGAINST DEFEAT BUT CANNOT MAKE CERTAIN OF DEFEATING THE ENEMY
HENCE THE SAYING ONE MAY KNOW HOW TO CONQUER WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO DO IT
SECURITY AGAINST DEFEAT IMPLIES DEFENSIVE TACTICS 
ABILITY TO DEFEAT THE ENEMY MEANS TAKING THE OFFENSIVE

WHAT THE ANCIENTS CALLED A CLEVER FIGHTER IS ONE WHO NOT ONLY WINS BUT EXCELS IN WINNING WITH EASE
HENCE HIS VICTORIES BRING HIM NEITHER REPUTATION FOR WISDOM NOR CREDIT FOR COURAGE

THE CLEVER COMBATANT IMPOSES HIS WILL ON THE ENEMY BUT DOES NOT ALLOW THE ENEMYS WILL TO BE IMPOSED ON HIM
BY HOLDING OUT ADVANTAGES TO HIM HE CAN CAUSE THE ENEMY TO APPROACH OF HIS OWN ACCORD OR BY INFLICTING DAMAGE HE CAN MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE ENEMY TO DRAW NEAR
IF THE ENEMY IS TAKING HIS EASE HE CAN HARASS HIM IF WELL SUPPLIED WITH FOOD HE CAN STARVE HIM OUT IF QUIETLY ENCAMPED HE CAN FORCE HIM TO MOVE

IN WAR PRACTICE DISSIMULATION AND YOU WILL SUCCEED
WHETHER TO CONCENTRATE OR TO DIVIDE YOUR TROOPS MUST BE DECIDED BY CIRCUMSTANCES
LET YOUR RAPIDITY BE THAT OF THE WIND YOUR COMPACTNESS THAT OF THE FOREST
IN RAIDING AND PLUNDERING BE LIKE FIRE IS IMMOVABILITY LIKE A MOUNTAIN
LET YOUR PLANS BE DARK AND IMPENETRABLE AS NIGHT AND WHEN YOU MOVE FALL LIKE A THUNDERBOLT

PONDER AND DELIBERATE BEFORE YOU MAKE A MOVE
HE WILL CONQUER WHO HAS LEARNT THE ARTIFICE OF DEVIATION SUCH IS THE ART OF MANEUVERING

IT IS A MILITARY AXIOM NOT TO ADVANCE UPHILL AGAINST THE ENEMY NOR TO OPPOSE HIM WHEN HE COMES DOWNHILL
DO NOT PURSUE AN ENEMY WHO SIMULATES FLIGHT DO NOT ATTACK SOLDIERS WHOSE TEMPER IS KEEN
DO NOT SWALLOW BAIT OFFERED BY THE ENEMY DO NOT INTERFERE WITH AN ARMY THAT IS RETURNING HOME
WHEN YOU SURROUND AN ARMY LEAVE AN OUTLET FREE DO NOT PRESS A DESPERATE FOE TOO HARD

THE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH TO MANAGE AN ARMY IS TO SET UP ONE STANDARD OF COURAGE WHICH ALL MUST REACH
HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF BOTH STRONG AND WEAKTHAT IS A QUESTION INVOLVING THE PROPER USE OF GROUND
THUS THE SKILLFUL GENERAL CONDUCTS HIS ARMY JUST AS THOUGH HE WERE LEADING A SINGLE MAN WILLYNILLY BY THE HAND
IT IS THE BUSINESS OF A GENERAL TO BE QUIET AND THUS ENSURE SECRECY UPRIGHT AND JUST AND THUS MAINTAIN ORDER
HE MUST BE ABLE TO MYSTIFY HIS OFFICERS AND MEN BY FALSE REPORTS AND APPEARANCES AND THUS KEEP THEM IN TOTAL IGNORANCE
BY ALTERING HIS ARRANGEMENTS AND CHANGING HIS PLANS HE KEEPS THE ENEMY WITHOUT DEFINITE KNOWLEDGE BY SHIFTING HIS CAMP AND TAKING CIRCUITOUS ROUTES HE PREVENTS THE ENEMY FROM ANTICIPATING HIS PURPOSE
AT THE CRITICAL MOMENT THE LEADER OF AN ARMY ACTS LIKE ONE WHO HAS CLIMBED UP A HEIGHT AND THEN KICKS AWAY THE LADDER BEHIND HIM HE CARRIES HIS MEN DEEP INTO HOSTILE TERRITORY BEFORE HE SHOWS HIS HAND
