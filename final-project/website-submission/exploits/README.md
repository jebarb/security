README for our exploits:
-----------------------

### fetchpass

Fetchpass was designed to abuse the reset token function on forgotpw.php

`python fetchpass.py` will run the exploit.

### php get_token.php

This function is hardcoded per account.

`php get_token.php [MY_IP] [DESIRED_PORT]` will run the exploit.  It may take several attempts to recover the APIKEY.

### compositestring.py

`python compositestring.py`

### kiddough.py
