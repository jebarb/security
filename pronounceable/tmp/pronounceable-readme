The pronounceable password files were created as follows:

Format:

username:hash where hash=sha1(salt:username:passwords) and the salt is the same 
as the one you found in the Task 3 of Homework 2.

Password generation scheme:

The passwords were generated using various techniques for generating 
"pronounceable" passwords. For the passwords you were able to recover, explain the algorithm that was used
to generate these passwords. Understanding how the passwords were created will help you in
cracking pronounceable passwords of length greater than 8.

Testing your solution:

To test your code note that the passwords for the first user in each file is the word ELEMENTS.


Files:

1 - Easy set: pronounceable8-salted
2 - Moderate set: pronounceable8-12-salted

You may want to read the paper "Isn't that fantabulous: Security, Linguistic and Usability
Challenges of Pronounceable Tokens" mentioned in the class. 
Let us know when you have cracked all the passwords in the set 1. 
Happy cracking for set 2 :)
